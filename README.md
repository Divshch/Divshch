<h3 align="center"> Data Analyst</h3>

With over two years of experience in data analysis, I have developed a strong foundation in finding actionable insights from complex datasets. My expertise encompasses utilizing tools like Airflow, Google BigQuery, ClickHouse and I am proficient in A/B testing to drive product improvements. As a product analyst at Uzum and previously at Bridigi Apps, I have honed my skills in adapting to fast-paced environments and delivering data-driven results that enhance product strategies.

Educated at Peter the Great St.Petersburg Polytechnic University, I hold both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Heat Power Engineering, providing me with a robust engineering background that enriches my analytical capabilities. I am dedicated to continuous learning, evidenced by my regular participation in data-related conferences and contributions to communities such as Habr and Kaggle.

My <a href="https://github.com/Divshch/portfolio.git">portfolio</a>, available on GitHub, showcases my ongoing commitment to growing my technical skills, currently focusing on Python and SQL. With a mindset geared towards innovation and excellence, I am always eager to contribute to and learn from challenging projects.
