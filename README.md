<h3 align="center"> Data Analyst</h3>

I am motivated to seek a new job in order to develop my skills and knowledge in the IT field, which has always interested me. I have chosen the profession of data analyst because I enjoy searching for patterns and answers in large sets of data. I am currently studying Python and SQL. I keep up with the latest trends in data analysis by following blogs and communities such as Habr and Kaggle, and also regularly attend data-related conferences and events. I am always looking for new opportunities for growth and development, and would be excited to participate in interesting projects.
